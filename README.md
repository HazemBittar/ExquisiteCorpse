   ### _Exquisite corpse_, also known as exquisite cadaver (from the original French term cadavre exquis), is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule.

> "The adjective noun adverb verb the adjective noun." as  in  "The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge.") or by  being allowed  to see only the end of what the previous  person contributed.

Dimitar Spisarevski was a Bulgarian fighter pilot known for taking down an American bomber by ramming it during the bombing of Sofia in World War II.
Born in Dobrich on 19 July 1916, Spisarevski moved with his family after the post-World War I Treaty of Neuilly ceded the city to Romania, consecutively living in Lom, Belogradchik and Sofia.
