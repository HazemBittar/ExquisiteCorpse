Dimitar Spisarevski was a Bulgarian fighter pilot known for taking down an American bomber by ramming it during the bombing of Sofia in World War II.
Born in Dobrich on 19 July 1916, Spisarevski moved with his family after the post-World War I Treaty of Neuilly ceded the city to Romania, consecutively living in Lom, Belogradchik and Sofia.
